I was told that the previous post on [hacking an exchange](https://sakurity.com/blog/2015/01/10/hacking-bitcoin-exchanger.html) led to some negative feedback about Yunbi/Peatio. It indeed needs some clarification.

First of all, no one was "hacked", it was just an attack scenario. We used the "hacking an exchange" title only as a clickbait. The audit results were reported to Peatio security team and everything was fixed in timely fashion.

The team was very responsive and we are going to have another engagement to make Peatio even more secure. 

Furthermore, we've conducted dozens of security audits for Rails apps and Peatio's source code is impressive. It's mature and production-ready framework to create a custom exchange with it.

Finally, the report is [available to download](https://sakurity.com/peatio.pdf).
